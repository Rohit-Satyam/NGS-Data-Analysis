## Data Compression

If you are looking for some permanent solution of compressing and storing data generated from NGS or Chipseq, the following literature might come at your rescue

1. [Which compression format should I use for NGS-related files?](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support-sv/faq/resources-faq/which-compression-format-should-i-use-for-ngs-related-files/)
2. [How should I compress FastQ-format files?](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support-sv/faq/resources-faq/how-should-i-compress-fastq-format-files/)
3. Not recommended though: Will show bias in Fastqc duplicates results: [FaStore: a space-saving solution for raw sequencing data](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/16/2748/4956350)
4. [Compression of FASTQ and SAM Format Sequencing Data](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0059190)
