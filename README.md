# NGS-Data-Analysis
# Introduction

This repository tries to enlist the best practices for NGS Data Analysis in general. It's also sequential arrangements of Best Practices of updated version of GATK 4.1.4.0 and on how to start with NGS Data analysis.

**Starters**
1. Basics on NGS: [Understanding the Basics of NGS: From Mechanism to Variant Calling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4633438/pdf/40142_2015_Article_76.pdf)
2. Illumina Sequencing Technology: [Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=womKfikWlxM) , [sequencing by synthesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCd6B5HRaZ8&t=38s)
3. Eric Chow [explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN8B7-Vhqww)  behind the chemistry behind Illumina sequencers
4. An interesting TED talk to get you excited: [How to read the genome and build a human being | Riccardo Sabatini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6rJLXq1Re0)
